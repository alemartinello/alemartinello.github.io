        Every year thousands of refugees are resettled to dozens of host
        countries. While there is growing evidence that the initial placement of
        refugee families profoundly affects their lifetime outcomes, there have
        been few attempts to optimize resettlement destinations. We integrate
        machine learning and integer optimization technologies into an
        innovative software tool that assists a resettlement agency in the
        United States with matching refugees to their initial placements. Our
        software suggests optimal placements while giving substantial autonomy
        for the resettlement staff to fine-tune recommended matches. Initial
        back-testing indicates that Annie can improve short-run employment
        outcomes by 22%-37%. We discuss several directions for future work such
        as incorporating multiple objectives from additional integration
        outcomes, dealing with equity concerns, evaluating potential new
        locations for resettlement, managing quota in a dynamic fashion, and
        eliciting refugee preferences.

        This paper makes two contributions to the consumption literature. First,
        we exploit inheritance episodes to provide novel causal evidence on the
        long-run effects of a large financial windfall on saving behavior. For
        identification, we combine a longitudinal panel of administrative wealth
        reports with variation in the timing of sudden, unexpected parental
        deaths. We show that after inheritance net worth converges towards the
        path established before parental death, with only a third of the initial
        windfall remaining after a decade. These dynamics are qualitatively
        consistent with convergence to a buffer-stock target. Second, we
        interpret these findings through the lens of a generalized
        consumption-saving framework. To quantitatively replicate this behavior,
        life-cycle consumption models require impatient consumers and strong
        precautionary saving motives, with implications for the design of
        retirement policy and the value of social insurance. This result also
        holds for two-asset models, which imply a high marginal propensity to
        consume.

    The Effects of Schooling on Wealth Accumulation Approaching Retirement</a></b><br>
    with Paul Bingley<br>

    <div class="panel"> 
        Education and wealth are positively correlated for individuals
        approaching retirement, but the direction of the causal relationship is
        ambiguous in theory and has not been identified in practice. We combine
        administrative data on individual total wealth with a reform expanding
        access to lower secondary school in Denmark in the 1950s, finding that
        schooling increases pension annuity claims but reduces the non-pension
        wealth of men in their 50â€™s. These effects grow stronger as normal
        retirement age approaches. Labour market mechanisms are key, with
        schooling reducing self-employment, increasing job mobility and
        employment in the public sector, and improving occupational pension
        benefits.
