        Every year thousands of refugees are resettled to dozens of host
        countries. While there is growing evidence that the initial placement of
        refugee families profoundly affects their lifetime outcomes, there have
        been few attempts to optimize resettlement destinations. We integrate
        machine learning and integer optimization technologies into an
        innovative software tool that assists a resettlement agency in the
        United States with matching refugees to their initial placements. Our
        software suggests optimal placements while giving substantial autonomy
        for the resettlement staff to fine-tune recommended matches. Initial
        back-testing indicates that Annie can improve short-run employment
        outcomes by 22%-37%. We discuss several directions for future work such
        as incorporating multiple objectives from additional integration
        outcomes, dealing with equity concerns, evaluating potential new
        locations for resettlement, managing quota in a dynamic fashion, and
        eliciting refugee preferences.

    Long-Run Saving Dynamics: Evidence from Unexpected Inheritances</a></b><br>

    <div class="panel"> 
        This paper makes two contributions to the consumption literature. First,
        we exploit inheritance episodes to provide novel causal evidence on the
        long-run effects of a large financial windfall on saving behavior. For
        identification, we combine a longitudinal panel of administrative wealth
        reports with variation in the timing of sudden, unexpected parental
        deaths. We show that after inheritance net worth converges towards the
        path established before parental death, with only a third of the initial
        windfall remaining after a decade. These dynamics are qualitatively
        consistent with convergence to a buffer-stock target. Second, we
        interpret these findings through the lens of a generalized
        consumption-saving framework. To quantitatively replicate this behavior,
        life-cycle consumption models require impatient consumers and strong
        precautionary saving motives, with implications for the design of
        retirement policy and the value of social insurance. This result also
        holds for two-asset models, which imply a high marginal propensity to
        consume.

    Seeing Through the Spin: The Effect of News Sentiment on Firms' Stock Market Performance</a></b><br>
    with Stine Louise Daetz, Anna Kirstine Hvid and Rastin Matin<br>
        <button class="accordion">
            Abstract
        </button>
    <div class="panel"> 
        The sentiment of news predicts the short-term stock market performance
        of individual companies. We find that this association is solely due to
        the idiosyncratic informational content of an article. We transparently
        quantify the association between news sentiment and stock market
        performance of S&P 500 companies, using articles written by Reuters
        between 2000 and 2018. First, we isolate the effect of sentiment
        independently of idiosyncratic informational content by exploiting a
        topic-based shift-share instrument. Second, we show that exogenous
        variation in article sentiment isolated through our topic-based
        shiftshare instrument, while strongly related to article sentiment, is
        unrelated to abnormal returns in the stock market.

    The Effects of Schooling on Wealth Accumulation Approaching Retirement</a></b><br>
    with Paul Bingley<br>
        <button class="accordion">
            Abstract
        </button>
    <div class="panel"> 
        Education and wealth are positively correlated for individuals
        approaching retirement, but the direction of the causal relationship is
        ambiguous in theory and has not been identified in practice. We combine
        administrative data on individual total wealth with a reform expanding
        access to lower secondary school in Denmark in the 1950s, finding that
        schooling increases pension annuity claims but reduces the non-pension
        wealth of men in their 50’s. These effects grow stronger as normal
        retirement age approaches. Labour market mechanisms are key, with
        schooling reducing self-employment, increasing job mobility and
        employment in the public sector, and improving occupational pension
        benefits.

        Dynamic Refugee Matching</a></b><br>
    with Tommy Andersson and Lars Ehlers<br>
        <button class="accordion">
            Abstract
        </button>
    <div class="panel"> 
        Only one percent of the 17.2 million asylum seekers in 2016 was part of
        international resettlement programs: The remaining 99 percent arrived
        directly to their host countries without assistance from resettlement
        agencies. These asylum seekers are assigned to a locality directly upon
        arrival based on some type of dynamic matching system, which is often
        uninformed and does not take the background of the asylum seekers into
        consideration. This paper proposes an informed, intuitive,
        easy-to-implement and computationally efficient dynamic mechanism for
        matching asylum seekers to localities. This mechanism can be adopted in
        any dynamic refugee matching problem given locality-specific quotas and
        that asylum seekers can be classified into specific types. We
        demonstrate that any matching selected by the proposed mechanism is
        Pareto efficient and that envy between localities is bounded by a single
        asylum seeker. We evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism in
        settings resembling the US and the Swedish situations, and show that our
        mechanism outperforms uninformed mechanisms even in presence of severe
        misclassification error in the estimation of asylum seeker types. With
        realistic misclassification error (24 percent), the proposed matching
        mechanism increases efficiency up to 75 percent, and guarantees a
        reduction in envy of between 17 and 50 percent.

        Measurement error in income and schooling, and the bias for linear estimators</a></b><br>

        We propose a general framework for determining the extent of measurement
        error bias in OLS and IV estimators of linear models, while allowing for
        measurement error in the validation source. We apply this method by
        validating Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)
        data with Danish administrative registers. Contrary to most validation
        studies, we find measurement error in income is classical, once we
        account for imperfect validation data. We find non-classical measurement
        error in schooling, causing a 38 percent amplification bias in IV
        estimators of the returns, with important implications for the program
        evaluation literature.

        We assess the validity of differences in eligibility ages for early and
        old age pension benefits as instruments for estimating the effect of
        retirement on cognitive functioning. Because differences in eligibility
        ages across country and gender are correlated with differences in years
        of schooling, which affect cognitive functioning at old ages, they are
        invalid as instruments without controlling for schooling. We show by
        means of simulation and a replication study that unless the model
        incorporates schooling, the estimated effect of retirement is negatively
        biased. This explains a large part of the “mental retirement” effects
        which have recently been found.

        Does Liquidity Substitute for Unemployment Insurance? Evidence from the 
        Introduction of Home Equity Loans in Denmark</a></b><br>
        with Kristoffer Marwardt and László Sandór<br>
        <button class="accordion">
            Abstract
        </button>
    <div class="panel"> 
        Would the value of unemployment insurance fall if more people had a
        buffer stock of liquid savings? Using quasi-experimental evidence from
        the unexpected introduction of home equity loans in Denmark, where
        public unemployment insurance is voluntary, we find that liquidity and
        insurance are substitutes. A Danish reform provided less levered
        homeowners with more liquidity. Using a ten-year-long panel dataset
        drawn from administrative registries, we find that people who obtained
        access to extra liquidity were less likely to sign up for unemployment
        insurance. The effect is concentrated among those for whom insurance has
        negative expected value. In this group, extra liquidity from housing
        equity worth one year’s income decreases insurance up-take by as much as
        a 0.3 percentage point fall in the risk of unemployment. Placebo tests
        for earlier years show no differential trends by leverage before the
        natural experiment. This implies that the liquidity of financial assets
        influences unemployment insurance uptake in the absence of public
        provision of insurance.
