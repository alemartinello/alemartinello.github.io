    "## Step 1: Understand what a table has to offer and how it is structured\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary example will be DST's table [*METROX1*](https://www.statistikbanken.dk/METROX1), which reports an index measuring the weekly amount of passengers travelling by metro in Copenhagen. This index was developed to measure the population's response to the COVID pandemic. The table is small and simple, allowing for quick experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The hard way\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know the table's name/id we can start by accessing the API directly through the python package `requests`, and ask about the table's metadata (`tableinfo`).\n",
    "\n",
    "An API call is composed by a main web address, a function call, and a set of parameters. The main web address is `https://api.statbank.dk/v1`. The function call in this case is `tableinfo`. The set of necessary parameters, per documentation, is the `id` of the table and the `format` in which we'd like to receive the information. We'll pick `\"metrox1\"` for the first (note that the table-id parameter is case-sensitive), and `\"JSON\"` for the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API at DST can be called through both `requests.get()` and `requests.post()`. DST's documentation recommends using `post`, because as the number and complexity of parameters grows (with some of them containing non-standard Danish characters) it's harder to embed them in an URL. However, as the call to `tableinfo` is simple, below I provide examples of using both methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `.json()` method of the `request.Response` object serves to return the response content (which we requested in JSON format) rather than the object itself. That's just to print out the output in the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function returns a wealth of information. Not just the table id and description, but also the contact of the statistics responsible, and, crucially, *names* and ***values*** of the variables defining the table. In this case `SÆSON` and `Tid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below shows how to get the table's metadata, and prints the beginning of the `JSON` file returned."

    "## Step 2: Get the data you need\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is essential for designing this second step. First and foremost because we need that information to design the call to `data`. Second, to make sure we only get out the data we need. Asking for too much data only to then having to throw half of it out locally is wasteful, and ultimately disrespectful for the resources invested into allowing **anyone** to fire up an API call (I mean how amazing is that?).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The hard way\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the first step, we'll start by doing it manually. Here I'll rely exclusively on `request.post()` as recommended by DST.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select the query parameters to pass to the `data` function appropriatedly one ought to have a careful look at the **DATA** section in [the documentation](https://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/brug-statistikken/muligheder-i-statistikbanken/api#metadataogdata). Nonetheless, hopefully the examples below will serve to clarify how to construct such calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two key parameters are, as before, the table name and the format in which we'd like to obtain the data. In the examples below I choose `BULK`, which has the advantage of being faster and allowing an unlimited number of data rows at export. There are some limitations with this format, such as the inability to perform simple computations (e.g. sums) on the fly. If you need these utilities, you probably don't need this guide, so I'll stick with `BULK` here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third crucial parameter is the selection based on the variables shown in e.g. `DstApi.tablesummary()`. These are mandatory: we need to specify the selection we want to do. We might however choose to include a range of possible values, or all of them, in a selection. In this case, the character `*` acts as a joker. So to select all values of a variable, we can use `*`. To select all 2020 weeks in `Tid`, we could use `2020*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I write the parameters necessary to download the seasonally adjusted (code 10) index for all weeks in the data, and pass them to `requests.post()`. Finally I print the first 200 characters of the data we received back (in `;`-separated format)."
