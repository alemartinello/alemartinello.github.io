title: "AI and machine learning in the financial sector: Five focus points"

You might know that the #europeancommission has submitted a [proposal for an AI act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0206).

The proposal defines high-risk AI systems, requires minimum governance structures for such systems, and imposes large fines for lack of compliance, up to 6% of a firm's global turnover.

The proposal as it stands will have consequences for the financial sector. Among high-risk systems, the act specifically includes systems for credit risk scores applied to natural persons - not only those using machine learning, but also those using standard statistical tools (logit, OLS, whatnot).

At Danmarks Nationalbank we have studied both the academic and non-academic literature, and consulted with national and international experts to understand the challenges and best practices in using AI in the financial sector. While machine learning is not a new paradigm for banks and financial institutions, who are used to exploit microdata and models to inform their business, it can amplify existing risks.

In [this memo](https://www.nationalbanken.dk/en/publications/Pages/2022/04/AI-and-machine-learning-in-the-financial-sector-Five-focus-points.aspx) we summarize our findings, and suggest five focus points for financial institution to consider when moving from static statistical models to self-learning, dynamic AI systems.
