# **TYPS** - **T**o **Y**our **P**ast **S**elf

## What's **TYPS**?

Some time ago, I read a twitter discussion where someone (I'd bet the brilliant [@vboykis](https://twitter.com/vboykis), but I can't seem to trace back the exact post) said that when she wrote blog posts on data science, she imagined writing them to her past self, about 4 years earlier.

What, among the knowledge you have now, would you have liked to know then? Which notes would you pass to yourself back in time? And how would you communicate them?

This line of thinking resonates with me for two reasons.

First, my past self who started to dabble in python and data science had a peculiar profile. While I had a good background in statistics and econometrics, which allowed me to quickly understand how lots of ML work. I knew how to proficiently use statistical softwares such as stata.

Second, when I was teaching at Lund University, as many new teachers fresh from a PhD, I initially made the mistake of speaking to students as if they were my peers, subconsciously trying to impress them. That's futile and harmful. Students **don't care how smart you look like**. They just want to learn, and are eager to start using what they learn to learn by themself. 

Your job as a teacher is not to dump all the stuff you know on them, but to help them stand on their feet, take their own steps in the right direction, and let them practice until they can confidently walk alone. You don't start with tips on how to run a marathon.
